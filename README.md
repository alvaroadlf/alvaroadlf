- 👋 Hi, I’m Alvaro, a Web and graphic designer with more than 10 years of experience working as self- employed.

    I was born on March 2, 1992 and from a very young age I have felt the call of new technologies. I am a born entrepreneur and from a very young age I try projects and try to carry them out. I love web design and graphic design, online marketing and in general everything that has to do with creativity.

    In order to expand my knowledge and specialize in the sector, I am currently studying a Master in UX/UI Design.

    I am currently fully available to change locations if the position requires it.

- 👀 I’m interested in #webdesign, #graphicdesign & #uxuidesign.

- 🌱 I’m currently studying a Master in UX/UI Design.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on little projects & startups.
